##  Data Analysis(Use mapreduce function to analysis)
(Sort out the shutdown airline before that)
- which day of week is the most likely to delay
- what time of day 
- On a specifc route, which airline tend to have most possibility of delay
- Bar graph of number of times delay for each year from 2003-2008
- Possibilty of delay for old plane comparing to new plane



## Machine Learning

### Recommendation

---

- From Boston to where. When is the best day(dalay possibility), best time, best airline
