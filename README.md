# Airline Delay Analysis and Prediction
---

### Project Goal
- Build a model which would allow a consumer to predict whether a flight they were interested in purchasing was most likely to arrive at their destination early, on time, or late


### The Data 
- Data came from [America Statistical Association](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/)

| ArrDelay		| Delay time in minutes 		|
| Origin		| Airport flight originated from|
